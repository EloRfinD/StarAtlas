3 Task analysis

To develop a program in the form of a web application, we use the programming language - Java, since this language provides speed, scalability due to a wide selection of libraries and frameworks for working with databases, good work with web applications. We will use libraries such as: spring, hibernate, jdbc, junit, log4j.

Sources of data (information) are catalogs of visible stars and other information obtained from reliable sources.

Ways to obtain information by the user:

• Clicking on the selected object;

• Text search (by ID, star name).

Functionality in the application:

• Camera zoom;

• Turning on/off the display of the Sun;

• Viewing the general list of added stars.

• Adding stars;

• Change of information;

• Loading third-party directories by the user.
